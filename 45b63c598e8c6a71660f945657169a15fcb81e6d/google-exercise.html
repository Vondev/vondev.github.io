				<h3>Chosen Community</h3>

			<div class ="content-column">
				The community I chose for this exercise is <b>6TenEast</b>, a residential apartment complex located in Sunnyvale, CA. I decided to go with this prompt and community because I had the greatest access to its users.

				<h2>Finding The Problem</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="content-column">
				<p>Located in the heard of Silicon Valley, 6TenEast is a relatively high-end apartment complex that offers well-furnished apartments and a robust set of common amenities. Management takes care of these amenities as well as most furnished appliances in the residents' apartments.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="spacer"></div>
			<div class="content-column">
				<h3>User Research</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="content-column">				
				To begin, I interviewed both 3 residents and the property manager of 6TenEast. While I was mainly gearing towards designing for the resident-end of the experience, I found it useful to interview the property manager because the workflow of the maintenance team plays a significant role in the resident's experience. For example, interviewing the property manager allowed me to find out the most common issues that residents call maintenance for.

				<div class="caption smaller-font">Samples from interview field notes</div>
			</div>

			<div class="spacer"></div>


			<div class ="content-column">

				<h5><span class="highlight-1">Finding 1 : </span>The vast majority of requests were about a small set of common issues.</h5>
				<p>These issues include light bulb changes, plumbing, smoke detector batteries, clogged sinks, and various appliance issues.</p>

				<h5><span class="highlight-1">Finding 2 : </span>The existing portal was not ideal in several ways.</h5>
				<p>While there exists a maintenance portal, it had several usability issues. The large number of categories and subcategories confused users, and the site was a very long form on one page. It was also desktop-only.</p>

				<h5><span class="highlight-1">Finding 3 : </span>Users often had varying preferences with regards to when and how the maintenance should enter their homes.</h5>
				<p>Some didn't mind them entering anytime, others wanted them to enter at a certain time, and some had quirks like not wanting them to wear their shoes into the house.</p>

				<h5><span class="highlight-1">Finding 4 : </span>There was no way to follow-up with the maintenance team or inquire about status on the site.</h5>
				<p>The only way was to call or email the leasing office, or go there physically.</p>

				<h5><span class="highlight-1">Finding 5 : </span>Human errors occur ocassionally for the maintenance staff.</h5>
				<p>The leasing office consultants was a middleman in the process - they had to print out the work orders each day and pass them to the maintenance team.</p>

				<h5><span class="highlight-1">Finding 6 : </span>Many users had difficulty logging into their portal.</h5>
				<p>Several residents I interviewed could not remember their password since they used it so infrequently, and relied on their laptop's password saving feature. The condo also hosts many corporate client residents who had no account in the first place.</p>

			<div class="content-column">
				<h3>Design Goal</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="content-column">				
				<blockquote>A user using the design should feel that requesting for maintenance is easy, fuss-free, and in accordance with how they want it to be done. In the process, they should also be confident that the work will be done and done promptly.</blockquote>

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="content-column">
			<p>With goals in mind and ideas in my head, I started sketching out some screens for the app, incorporating these wherever I could. I tried to keep everything as simple as possible but also useful at the same time.</p>

			<div class="spacer"></div>
			<p><b>Authentication</b> &mdash; I wanted to give users the ability to login without an account, by using other factors that the management office keeps track of.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="content-column image-wrapper">
			<img class="border-single" src="assets/wireframe1.png"></img>
		</div>


		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<div class="content-column">
			<p><b>Request maintenance</b> &mdash; All users mentioned that they tried to solve the problem themselves, procrastinated, then finally requested maintenance online. At the same time, the property sometimes faces issues that are solvable by doing-it-yourself (DIY) and are faced by many residents. Hence, I added a way for the office to update residents using guides and articles if they want to DIY.</p>

			<p>While requesting for maintenance, the user can also indicate preferences, such as time, and not wearing shoes at home.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column image-wrapper">
			<img class="border-single" src="assets/wireframe2.png"></img>
		</div>



		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<div class="content-column">
			<p><b>Keeping track of maintenance</b> &mdash; Users mentioned that they did not know maintenance was complete until they were home and verified it for themselves. Hence, I added a more in-depth progress bar would be useful for those who want to keep track of it. To ensure that this is feasible for the maintenance team, I needed to ensure it was easy to update.</p>

			<p>I also thought the ability to directly message the team was the best way to coordinate situations that are more uncommon. For example, a user might have diffiulties scheduling a time with the maintenance team due to a busy schedule, or someone might face a complex maintenance issue requires a drawn-out period of time to repair.</p>

			<h2>Final Design</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>I fleshed out my wireframes into a more detailed, high-fidelity prototype arbitrarily named <b>Fixit</b> (<i>6TenEast Maintenance Request App</i> is just too long), expanding on each workflow discussed in the wireframes. I also tried to design a look-and-feel that was as simple and clean as possible, which I thought befit the simple nature of a maintenance request app. The design uses a combination of parts from Material Design and several of my self-created UI elements.</p>

		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<div class="content-column">
			<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>Having to decide on specific details also forced me to think of things not present in my wireframes, such as the overall information architecture. One prominent addition is the bottom navigation bar. Each button on the bar represents an independent task and user flow: New Maintenance Request, Maintenance Request History, and Messaging respectively. Each of these user flows will be highlighted below.</p>

		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<div class="content-column">
			<h3>Alternative Login</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>Once again, the login user flow mainly focuses on logging in without an email and password. Here, clicking <i>I Don't Have An Account</i> brings them to a screen where they can use their last name, unit number, and phone number to login (all of which are stored in management's system).</p>

		<div class="content-column">
			<h3>Read Updates & Guides</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">

			<p>However, it also features an "Alternatively..." section that brings users to a list of guides and articles published by management. This was designed in response to all users mentioning that they tried to fix the problems themselves first, and also to the fact that some of the common problems are fixable with DIY.</p>

			<h3>Create Maintenance Request</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">

			<p>This is the primary feature of the tab, and brings resident users into a multistep process to create a maintenance request. Unlike the existing desktop portal that features many categories, this process features only a few, including the <b>top 4 categories uncovered through user research</b> (lights, smoke detector, plumbing, appliances).</p>

			<p>After selecting a category, the resident user is immediately led to input the problem in freeform text. Since the data is meant to be read by humans in the maintenance team, there is no need for the user to neatly fill in endless forms like "Location, Problem Type...etc". Instead, the description can be brief or long depending on the user's problem.</p>

			<p>From my interviews, priority is given to different resident requests based on the maintenance team's own judgement. To provide more information for this judgement, the form asks for the resident's urgency as well. At the end of the form, the user can enter preferences such as "no shoes in the house". These were distilled from common concerns uncovered through user research as well.</p>

		<div class="content-column">
			<h3>View Maintenance Requests</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">

			<p>I chose to use Material Design cards for each request because each request represented a distinct object. Upon tapping on each card, the user can view details for the request, and modify or delete it. They can also see the status of the request and follow-up through messages (which brings them to the <i>Messages</i> Tab).</p>

			<p>To ensure that the new progress bar is feasible for the maintenance team, I needed to make sure it was easy to update. Here, the cutoff points are clear: <i>Seen by office</i> and <i>Complete</i> are automatically updated, and only "Work in progress" needs to be updated manually.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="content-column image-wrapper  width-limiter-wide">

		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<div class="content-column">
			<h3>Messaging</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>Since the technician for each maintenance request is randomly assigned, it does not make sense to have each conversation thread be a specific person. Instead, each thread here corresponds to a different maintenance request. Within each thread, the user can view details of the request and go there with the click of a button. One was my initial worries was that a separate <i>Messages</i> tab would create a disconnect between a request and its messages. This bidirectional link between a request and its messages seeks to alleviate that.</p>

		<a id="discussion"></a>
		<div class="section-divider"><hr></div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<h2>Discussion</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>Moving forward, I would first and foremost like to conduct some in-depth user testing to verify my design. Several questions I have include: how users would respond to the DIY section of the app or simply ignore it, and if they would truly prefer a multi-step process with progressive disclosure v.s. having the entire form on one page. To truly find out if the design will be useful, this would have to be tested with both residents and the maintenance team as well.</p>

			<p>Since I created the design with feasibility issues in mind, I would like to touch on that aspect as well. One major drawback of Fixit is that it may be too specific to this singular community, 6TenEast. Hence, one way to improve it is to make it more generalizable to other residences while retaining the ability to customize questions and other areas of the app.</p>
