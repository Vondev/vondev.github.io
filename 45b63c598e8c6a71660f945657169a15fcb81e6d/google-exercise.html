				<h2>Prompt</h2>

			<div class ="content-column">
				<blockquote>A great residential community (e.g. condominium, college dormitory, etc.) provides a variety of amenities and a dedicated staff responsible for its maintenance. But there isn’t always an easy way for community members to report problems to management so they can be resolved quickly.</blockquote>
			</div>

			<div class ="content-column">
				<h3>Chosen Community</h3>
			</div>


			<div class ="content-column">
				The community I chose for this exercise is <b>6TenEast</b>, a residential apartment complex located in Sunnyvale, CA. I decided to go with this prompt and community because I had the greatest access to its users.

				<h2>Research</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="content-column">
				<p>Located in the heard of Silicon Valley, 6TenEast is a high-end apartment complex that offers well-furnished apartments and a myriad of common area amenities. The property's management office is responsible for taking care of both the common area facilities and the furnished appliances in the residents' apartments. There is an onsite maintenance team of 4 that takes care of maintenance requests.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="content-column">
				<h3>User Interviews</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="content-column">				
				To begin, I interviewed 3 residents who had submitted maintenance requests in the past year, as well as the property manager. While I was mainly designing for the resident's end of the experience, I found it immensely useful to interview the property manager because of her extensive knowledge of maintenance work at the property. For example, interviewing the property manager allowed me to find out the most common issues that residents request maintenance for.

			<div class="content-column">
				<h3>Findings</h3>
			</div>

			<div class ="content-column">

				<p><b>The vast majority of requests were about a small set of common issues</b> &mdash; These issues include light bulb changes, plumbing, smoke detector batteries, clogged sinks, and various appliance issues.</p>

				<p><b>The existing maintenance portal had room for improvement</b> &mdash; For example, the large number of categories and subcategories confused users, and the site was a very long form on one page. Users could not easily follow-up and find out about their repair's status. The site was also desktop-only.</p>

				<p><b>Users often had different preferences on how maintenance should be conducted in their homes</b> &mdash; Some didn't mind maintenance workers entering anytime, others wanted them to enter at a certain time, and some had quirks like not wanting them to wear their shoes into the house.</p>

				<p><b>There was no way to follow-up with the maintenance team on the site</b> &mdash; The only way was to call or email the leasing office, or go there physically.</p>

				<p><b>The current workflow was prone to human error</b> &mdash; The leasing office was a middleman in the process - they had to print out the work orders each day and pass them to the maintenance team.</p>

				<p><b>Users had difficulty logging into their portal</b> &mdash; Several users could not remember their password since they used the site so infrequently. The condo also hosts many corporate client residents who have no account in the first place.</p>

			<a id="design-goals"></a>
			<div class="section-divider"><hr></div>

			<div class="content-column">
				<h2>Design Goals</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="content-column">				
				<p>Drawing from the results of the user interviews, I decided that my solution should try to achieve most of the following:</p>
			</div>

			<div class="content-column">				
				<p><b>Easier authentication</b> &mdash; There should be a way for residents with or without residential portal accounts to access the solution.</p>

				<p><b>Lower barriers of requesting maintenance</b> &mdash; Users who tend to put off these things due to the hassle should feel encouraged to use it due to how easy it is.</p>

				<p><b>Keep users updated</b> &mdash; Users should be kept updated of the status of their request.</p>

				<p><b>Easier communication</b> &mdash; Users should find it easy to communicate with maintenance workers.</p>

				<p><b>Help users to help themselves</b> &mdash; If users wanted to fix something themselves, the app should support them.</p>

				<p><b>Minimum difficulty for maintenance team </b> &mdash; Improvements for residents should not come at the expense of the maintenance team, or it is unlikely that the solution is feasible in the long term.</p>

			</div>

<div class="content-column">
				<h3>Overall Goals</h3>
			</div>

			<div class="content-column">				
				<blockquote>A user using the design should feel that requesting for maintenance is easy and fuss-free. Its design should encourage maintenance to be done when and how a resident wants it to be done. Through using the app, resident should feel confident that the work will be done and done promptly.</blockquote>

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="content-column">
			<p>With these goals and ideas in my head, I started sketching out some screens for the app. I tried to incorporate as many of these goals as I could while keeping the app as simple as possible.</p>

			<div class="spacer"></div>
			<p><b>Authentication</b> &mdash; To allow users to login without an account, I thought of using other factors for authentication. These factors has to be ones that the management office keeps track of in their database.</p>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p><b>Create maintenance requests</b> &mdash; All users who used the online portal mentioned that they tried to solve the maintenance problem themselves, before procrastinating, and then finally did so. At the same time, the property sometimes faces issues that are potentially solvable through DIY methods, or common issues that plague many residents. Hence, I added a way for the office to keep residents informed of specific issues that they may come across.</p>

			<p>Since different residents have different preferences, it was important that each request was customizable. Here, a user can indicate preferences, such as scheduling a time, or not entering the home with shoes on.</p>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p><b>Keeping track of maintenance</b> &mdash; One user mentioned that he did not know maintenance was complete until he was home one day and checked it for himself. Here, I added a progress bar that displays the progress of a maintenance request. To ensure that this is feasible for the maintenance team, I needed to ensure it was easy to update.</p>

			<p>I also thought that it was important for users to be able to communicate with the maintenance team easily, especially for uncommon problems. For example, a user might have diffiulties scheduling a time with the maintenance team due to a busy schedule, or someone might face a complex maintenance issue requires a drawn-out period of time to repair. Here, I thought of using a simple messaging feature to accomplish that.</p>

			<h2>Final Design</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>I fleshed out my wireframes into a more detailed, high-fidelity prototype arbitrarily named <b>Fixit</b> (<i>6TenEast Maintenance Request App</i> is just too long). I expanded each feature discussed in the wireframes into complete user flows, which will be discussed below.</p>

			<p>I also tried to design a look-and-feel that was as simple, clean, and befitting of the humble nature of a maintenance request app. The design uses a combination of parts from Material Design and several of my self-created UI elements. <a target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/3ER0UTYG42A">Try the InVision prototype here!</a></p>

		<div class="content-column">
			<h3>Navigation Bar</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>Fleshing out specific details forced me to think of things not present in my wireframes, such as the app's information architecture. One relevant addition here is the bottom navigation bar. Each button on the bar represents an independent task and user flow: <i>New Maintenance Request</i>, <i>My Maintenance Requests</i>, and <i>Messages</i> respectively. Each of these user flows will be highlighted below.</p>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>Once again, the login user flow mainly focuses on logging in without an email and password. Here, clicking <i>I Don't Have An Account</i> brings them to a screen where they can use their last name, unit number, and phone number to login (all of which are stored in management's system).</p>

			<h3>Read Updates & Guides</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">

			<p>Perhaps a surprising feature on the <i>New Maintenance Request</i> page is a "alternative" section that brings users to a list of guides and articles published by management. This was designed in response to all users mentioning that they tried to fix the problems themselves first, and also to the fact that some common problems may be fixable with DIY. It helps users to try to fix something before resorting to calling maintenance.</p>

			<h3>Create Maintenance Request</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">

			<p>This is the primary feature of the tab, and brings resident users into a multi-step process to create a maintenance request. Unlike the existing desktop portal that features many categories, this process features only a few problem categories, including the <b>top 4 categories uncovered through user research:</b> lights, smoke detector, plumbing, appliances.</p>

			<p>After selecting a category, the resident user is immediately led to input the problem in freeform text. Since the data is meant to be read by humans in the maintenance team, there is no need for the user to neatly fill in endless forms like "Location, Problem Type... etc". Instead, the description can be brief or long depending on the problem at hand.</p>

			<p>According to the property manager, priority is given to different resident requests based on the maintenance team's own judgement. To provide more information for this judgement, the form asks for the resident's urgency as well. At the end of the form, the user can enter preferences such as "no shoes in the house". These were distilled from common concerns uncovered through user research as well.</p>

			<h3>View Maintenance Requests</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">

			<p>I chose to use Material Design cards for each request because each request represented a distinct object. Upon tapping on each card, the user can view details for the request, and modify or delete it. They can also see the status of the request and follow-up through messages (which brings them to the <i>Messages</i> Tab).</p>

			<p>To ensure that the new progress bar is feasible for the maintenance team, I needed to make sure it was easy to update. Here, the cutoff points are clear: <i>Seen by office</i> and <i>Complete</i> are automatically updated, and only "Work in progress" needs to be updated manually.</p>

		<div class="spacer"></div>
		<div class="content-column">
			<h3>Messaging</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>Since the technician for each maintenance request is randomly assigned, it does not make sense to have each conversation thread be a specific person. Instead, each thread here corresponds to a different maintenance request. Within each thread, the user can view details of the request and go there with the click of a button. One was my initial worries was that a separate <i>Messages</i> tab would create a disconnect between a request and its messages. This bidirectional link between a request and its messages seeks to alleviate that.</p>

		<a id="discussion"></a>
		<div class="section-divider"><hr></div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<h2>Discussion</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="content-column">
			<p>Going forward, the first I would like to do is to conduct user testing to validate my design. Some questions I have in my head are &mdash; whether users would respond to the DIY section of the app or simply ignore it; If users would prefer a multi-step process v.s. having the entire form on one page. To truly find out if the design will be useful, this would have to be tested with both residents and the maintenance team.</p>

			<p>Since I created the design with feasibility issues in mind, I would like to touch on that aspect as well. One major drawback of Fixit is that it may be too specific to the singular community of 6TenEast. One way to improve it is to make Fixit more generalizable to other residences while retaining the ability to customize questions and other areas of the app.</p>
