			<p>My name is Jesse and I am a UX designer currently based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I strive to craft usable, beautiful, and heuristically-sound solutions that are grounded in user research. My previous companies and clients include <b>Assurant</b>, <b>Microsoft Research</b>, <b>Lowe's</b>, and <b>Halliburton</b>.</p>

			<p>With a background in both Human-Computer Interaction and Software Engineering, I am deeply passionate about the intersection of technology and design. I enjoy every aspect of the design process from research to design to implementation. I love the dual challenges of creating designs that look and feel good to the user while furthering the goals of the business.</p>

			<p>I am currently on the lookout for opportunities in UX, UI, and Product Design. Feel free to reach out to me anytime!</p>
