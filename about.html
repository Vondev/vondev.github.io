			<p>Hey there, I'm Jesse.</p>

			<p>I am a product designer who wears multiple hats — I enjoy not only UI/UX design but software development as well. This unique background allows me to seamlessly bring my designs to fruition by implementing them in code when needed. It also means that I can collaborate easily with developers and ensure that a design is implemented accurately and successfully. I bring value to an organization by being versatile, detail-oriented, and holding my work to high standards.</p>

			<p>As a designer, I have lots of experience in crafting prototypes, conducting user research, and administering usability testing to validate my designs. I believe that the user-centered design process can be leveraged in small ways even if an organization lacks resources for a more formal approach.</p>

			<p>Like many people, I love beautiful things — I believe that an aesthetically pleasing interface plays an important role in generating a great user experience. Hence, in my spare time, I revel in crafting pixel-perfect designs in Sketch or Figma, and honing my eye for design on sites like Dribbble.</p>

			<p>I currently work at <b>GetInsured</b>, a SaaS technology company in the San Francisco Bay Area. My previous companies and clients include <b>Assurant</b>, <b>Microsoft Research</b>, <b>Lowe's</b>, and <b>Halliburton</b>. I am open to opportunities at the moment, so feel free to reach out.</p>
