			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>As "pioneers" in their own right, first generation college students often face unique challenges in their college lives. Through an iterative user-centered design process, I designed, prototyped, and tested Pioneers, a mobile app that helps first-gen students to network with and seek mentorship from first-gen alumni and upperclassmen.</p>

			<h2>The General Problem Space</h2>

			<div class="project-page-image">

			</div>
			

			<p>First-gen students, comprising 30% of college students in the United States, often face greater challenges in certain areas compared to non-first gen students. For example, they are disproportionately from a low income background or socioeconomic class and graduate at lower rates. They are more likely than average to report feelings of inadequacy in their academic ability, social life and socioeconomic status.</p>

			<blockquote>How can we improve the overall experience of first-generation college students at Cornell?</blockquote>

			<p>Our initial general problem statement comprises multiple interconnected problems spanning different areas. To begin designing a solution, our team first had to narrow down the scope of our project.</p>

			<h2>Interviewing Users</h2>

			<p>We started by recruiting and interviewing 6 first-generation college students at Cornell and got them to talk about their college lives.</p>

			<h3><span class="highlight-one">Insight 1 :</span> Role Models</h3>
			<p>Our interviewees expressed that it was motivating to see or interact with another first-gen student or alumni who was successful.</p>

			<h3><span class="highlight-one">Insight 2 :</span> Not part of the club</h3>
			<p>Students often feel a sense of inconfidence when it comes to networking. They feel that they and their family don't have the same connections that other students do.</p>

			<h3><span class="highlight-one">Insight 3 :</span> School Family Divide</h3>
			<p>There is a divide between school and family life. Students had problems communicating with their parents and other family members regarding college matters. There is an asynchrony between their parents' view of their college life and their own.</p>

			<h2>Narrowing Down The Problem Space</h2>

			<p>In response to the user research findings, each of us went crazy and sketched up 120 ideas as a group. However, we quickly realized that it was impossible to actually decide on what to go with without narrowing down our general problem statement. After revisiting our interview findings, a good deal of discussion, and some soul searching, we narrowed down our problem statement to the following:</p>

			<blockquote>First-generation college students at Cornell often feel left out in networking, socializing, and being "in the know". They find it difficult to network and connect with other students, both first-gen and non-first-gen.</blockquote>

			<p>The reason we decided to go with this was because our participants found role models to be helpful and networking to be difficult. At the same time, we thought that the knowledge gained from socializing and mentorship could also indirectly benefit other problem areas like feeling left out. Through a process of elimination, we zoned in on one of the ideas: <span class="bold">an digital solution that helps with networking and mentorship.</span> </p>

			<h2>The Design Process</h2>

			<h3>Pioneers</h3>

			<p>First-generation students are the pioneers in their family to attend college, and it was important that they make full use of the opportunities that their parents never had. We named our solution <b>Pioneers</b>, a smartphone app that helps first-gen Cornell students network and find mentorship by connecting with first-gen alumni and upperclassmen.</p>
			
			<p>Our design's emphasis was on reducing the barriers to networking as much as possible and fostering a friendly and welcoming environment.</p>

			<h3>Paper Wireframes</h3>

			<p>For the first iteration of our app, I sketched up a low-fidelity wireframe with pencil and paper.</p>
