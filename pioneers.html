				<h2>Overview</h2>

				<p>As "pioneers" in their own right, first-generation college students often face unique challenges in their college lives. Through an iterative user-centered design process, I designed, prototyped, and tested Pioneers, a mobile app that helps first-gen students to network with and seek mentorship from first-gen alumni and upperclassmen.</p>

				<h2>The General Problem Space</h2>


				<p>First-generation college students, comprising 30% of all college students in the United States, often face greater challenges in certain areas compared to non-first gen students. For example, they are more likely to report feelings of inadequacy in their academic ability, social life, and socioeconomic status than non-first-gen students. They are also disproportionately from a low income background or socioeconomic class, and graduate at lower rates. </p>

				<blockquote>How can we improve the overall experience of first-generation college students at Cornell?</blockquote>

				<p>Our initial general problem statement comprises multiple interconnected problems spanning different areas. To begin designing a solution, our team first had to narrow down the scope of our project.</p>

				<h2>Interviewing Users</h2>

				<p>We started by recruiting and interviewing 6 first-generation college students at Cornell and got them to talk about their college lives.</p>
			</div>

				<h3><span class="highlight-one">Finding 1 :</span> Role Models</h3>
				<p>Our interviewees expressed that it was motivating to see or interact with another first-gen student or alumni who was successful.</p>

				<h3><span class="highlight-one">Finding 2 :</span> Not part of the club</h3>
				<p>Students often feel a sense of inconfidence when it comes to networking. They feel that they and their family don't have the same connections that other students do.</p>

				<h3><span class="highlight-one">Finding 3 :</span> School Family Divide</h3>
				<p>There is a divide between school and family life. Students had problems communicating with their parents and other family members regarding college matters. There is an asynchrony between their parents' view of their college life and their own.</p>

				<h2>Narrowing Down The Problem Space</h2>

				<p>In response to the user research findings, each of us went crazy and sketched up 120 ideas as a group. However, we quickly realized that it was impossible to actually decide on what to go with without narrowing down our general problem statement. After revisiting our interview findings, a good deal of discussion, and some soul searching, we narrowed down our problem statement to the following:</p>

				<blockquote>First-generation college students at Cornell often feel left out in networking, socializing, and being "in the know". They find it difficult to network and connect with other students, both first-gen and non-first-gen.</blockquote>

				<p>The reason we decided to go with this was because our participants found role models to be helpful and networking to be difficult. At the same time, we thought that the knowledge gained from socializing and mentorship could also indirectly benefit other problem areas, such as feeling left out. Through a process of elimination, we zoned in on one of the ideas: <span class="bold">an digital solution that helps with networking and mentorship.</span> </p>

				<h2>The Design Process</h2>

				<p>Inspired by the fact that first-generation students are the metaphorical "pioneers" in their families to attend college, I decided to name our digital solution just that: <span class="bold italic">Pioneers</span> would be a smartphone app that helps first-gen Cornell students network and find mentorship by connecting with first-gen alumni and upperclassmen. The core emphasis of this app was to reduce the barriers to networking as much as possible by making it feel fun, friendly, and welcoming.</p>

				<h3>Paper Wireframes</h3>

				<p>For the first iteration of our app, I sketched up a low-fidelity wireframe with pencil and paper.</p>

				<h3>User Testing</h3>

				<p>We presented 3 users with our paper prototype and asked them to perform a set of tasks using the prototype's affordances. As this was the first time we presented the app to users, we focused more on what users thought about our concept.</p>

				<p>I facilitated the sessions by simulating the prototype's page changes in response to user actions. Users were encouraged to “think aloud” and provide feedback on experiences they found confusing, challenging, negative, positive, etc. We took note of both their verbal and non-verbal responses, and interviewed them post-session.</p>

				<div class="spacer"></div>

				<h4>What Users Liked</h4>

				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>All users mentioned that they liked the overall concept of the app.</li>
						<li>They agreed that cold-calling or reaching out to a complete stranger was daunting, and it would be good if the app can help with that.</li>
						<li>The "Journey" feature of the app was well-received and seen as unique for a networking app.</li>
						<li>Interviewees expressed the opinion that if they were added to the app as a Mentor, they would try to give advice and help as much as possible.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<div class="spacer"></div>

				<h4>Issues Users Had</h4>

				<p>
					<ul>
						<li>Users mentioned that they wanted to see questions answered by a specific Mentor, as well as a list of their own questions.</li>
						<li>One user wanted the ability to message a Mentor before adding them.</li>
						<li>Users mentioned that they wanted the app to retain the element of “intimacy” found in "early Facebook", where things were less structured and networks were smaller. Mentees might retain 50 mentors but have little flow of information between the mentors and mentees.</li>
					</ol>
				</p>

				<div class="spacer"></div>

				<h3>Medium-Fidelity Prototype</h3>

				<p>Next, I turned the paper prototype into a medium-fidelity prototype using Sketch. Design changes were drawn from a combination of insights gained from the user tests and a heuristic evaluation. Screens outlining the main app functions are shown below.</p>

				<h3>User Testing</h3>

				<p>We recruited 6 first-generation students for our second user test. Each 45-minute session was held individually with one facilitator and one notetaker. The medium-fidelity prototype was loaded onto a cellphone and presented to each participant. We assessed the prototype by examining the difficulties faced and emotions exhibited by each user, their "think-aloud comments, and their post-test interview responses.</p>
