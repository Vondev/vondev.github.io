			<h3>Overview</h3>

			<h4>As "pioneers" in their own right, first generation college students often face unique challenges in their college lives. Through an iterative user-centered design process, I designed, prototyped, and tested Pioneers, a mobile app that helps first-gen students to network with and seek mentorship from first-gen alumni and upperclassmen.</h4>

		<div class ="project-page-prose">

			<h4>Starting out with a general problem statement, we explored the problem space and conducted user research to gain a general understanding of our users. Through extensive discussion and brainstorming, we narrowed down our scope to specific problems that we were confident of tackling within our limitations. We iteratively designed prototypes of increasing fidelity and user testing in between.</h4>

			<h3>The Problem Space</h3>

			<h4>First-gen students, comprising 30% of college students in the United States, often face greater challenges in certain areas compared to non-first gen students. For example, they are disproportionately from a low income background or socioeconomic class and graduate at lower rates. They are more likely than average to report feelings of inadequacy in their academic ability, social life and socioeconomic status.</h4>

			<h4>How can we improve the overall experience of first-generation college students at Cornell?</h4>

			<h4>Our initial general problem statement comprises multiple interconnected problems spanning different areas. To begin designing a solution, our team first had to narrow down the scope of our project.</h4>

			<h3>User Research</h3>

			<h4>We started by recruiting and interviewing 6 first-generation college students at Cornell and got them to talk about their college lives.</h4>
